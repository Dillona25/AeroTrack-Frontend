## AviNews

Ive always had a passion for aviation. To do this day I still find myself waking up in the mornings enjoying a drink and reading the most reent aviation news. I will never stop following the industry. For that reason I created a full staxk website that allows me to do just that completely for free.

## How to run locally

1.) Clone this repo `git@github.com:Dillona25/AviNews.git` and clone the backend repo as well `git@github.com:Dillona25/AviNews-Backend.git`
2.) Open the frontend and run it with `npm run dev`
3.) Open and run the backend in a second window with your IDE using `npm run dev`. As a result in your temrinal you should see that the app is listening on port 3001.
4.) Once you have the frontend and backend running at the same time, you can use the project as expected.
