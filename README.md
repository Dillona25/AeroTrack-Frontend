## AviNews

Ive always had a passion for aviation. To do this day I still find myself waking up in the mornings enjoying a drink and reading the most recent aviation news. AviNews is a website that allows you to do just that. Users can create an account and browse the latest aviaiton related news. Users can also save articles they may want to read later.

Find the live site here

```bash
https://www.avinews.twilightparadox.com/
```

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:Dillona25/AviNews.git
```

  git clone git@github.com:Dillona25/AviNews-Backend.git
```

Open the backend in your IDE and install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

## Currently Working On üßëüèº‚Äçüíª

- As of 9/02/2024: Currently I am working on adding a feature to the site that allows users to not only ready news articles but also track flight data. I am currently working on finding a compatible and affordable API to do this. Additionally, I am working to add a "Recommended News" section as well as a section that tracks the top Aviation Stock prices and performance. I am pushing to have these updates released 10/01/2924.
