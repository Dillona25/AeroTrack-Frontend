          Hello ðŸ‘‹ Im Dillon, a full-stack engineer proficient in
          JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Node, and Express.
          <br />
          Growing up I always had asiprations of becoming a pilot. In highschool
          I completed two years of ground school and passed my FAA learners
          permit exam needed to begin flying and getting my private pilots
          license. Unfortunately I was never able to pass the thrid class
          medical exam due to an extensive medical history. What I always knew
          in the back of my head was now a reality: I would never be able to
          become a pilot due to my medical history. Now in 2024 I am a full
          stack engineer coupling my two passions of aviation and software
          development.
