Thursday 24th:

1. Response is being sent as a list of objects which is what we want

    - Find a way to itterate over these objects and update the table.

        - This is how the git repo is parsing the data 

            ```console.log(`Flight No: ${route.flightNumber}`);
                console.log(`From ${route.departureIata} (${route.departureTime}) to ${route.arrivalIata} (${route.arrivalTime})`);
                console.log(`Airlines: ${route.airlineIata}`);
                console.log(`Registration Numbers: ${route.regNumber}`);```

    - Worth noting we might not even need to use a state variable. Might be able to create the API fetchs with Axios in the flight table component
